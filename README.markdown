Wicket Information Objects
==========================

This project is a proof of concept trying to simplify change introduction into software development using the stack Wicket + Hibernate + Guice. The objective is to build a generic and homogeneus method for building forms for adding & editing domain objects and panels that display domain objects detailed information. Everything is done by inspecting domain objects metadata. The project was developed by members of the IT Development Team at ITBA (Buenos Aires Institute of Technology). See copyright notes at the bottom.
